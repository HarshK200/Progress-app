- [x] Use Doubly-Linked list for ordering list-cards
- [x] BUG FIX: app breaks when two cards from one list are dropped next to each other in some other list
      (this was a closure issue, because of where and how the function is written it froms a closure which
      captures the draggingCardList value and hence causes issues)
- [x] BUG FIX: the infinite loop bug on two card swap in the same list. (just had to do an early return)
- [x] Implement drag and drop functionality like trello for listcards (use pragmatic dnd)
      (DONE: made listcard dragable,

    State changes:
    - update list, listCard, board
- [ ] Right click menu to delete board.

- [ ] Add Skeleton loading ui for board lists and listcards

- [ ] Polish up the edit-menu for list and list-cards both
        - make it so that prev open one closes when goes out of focus
        - also upon clicking somewhere randomly also closes the edit-menu
